Node-Sword
======================

See the Node.js C++ [addons page](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/addons.html) for details of the examples here.

Install node-sword:

```sh
$ npm install node-sword
```

**See the [v0.11](https://github.com/rvagg/node-addon-examples/tree/v0.11/) branch for updated examples applicable to Node v0.11 and above.**

## Compatibility notes

### Node v0.10+
### Unix based system


```js

```

Omission of the current isolate will only trigger a compile-time warning at this stage but addon authors wishing to remove those warnings and remain backward-compatible with v0.10 and prior may need to get creative with macros:

```js

```
